VIEW:
Complete HTML part, which we want to show the user.
We can call view through controller and simply from route also.
If you want to return the view through route:
Route::get('/',function(){
    return view('about');
});
If you want to return the view through controller:
1. In controller make a function:
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public funtion index(){
        return view('about');
    }
}
2. In web.php, route this controller and the function:
Route::get('about',[UserController::class,'index']);

PASS PARAMETERS IN VIEW:
1. Route::get('about/{user}',[UserController::class,'index']);
2. In controller:
class UserController extends Controller
{
    public funtion index($user){
        return view('about',['name'=>$user]);
    }
}
3. In view, users.blade.php:
<h1>Hello{{$name}}</h1>

QUESTION?
Is there any function to check that the view exists or not?
We made the controller though command line, but we don't make the view with the command line?
