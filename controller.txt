CONTROLLER:
Controller is a central unit which keeps everything connected: Model, View and Router.
We take database in the Model and connect it with the controller, and controller takes it to the view.
To make a controller, use this command:
php artisan make:controller UserController (it will create the controller inside Https/Controllers)

class UserController extends Controller
{
    function show(){
        return "Hello from Controller.";
    }
}
Then call this controller on the route:
Go to web.php, first give the path of this controller: use App\Https\Controllers\UserController;
Route::get("user",[UserController::class,'show']);

PARAMETERS THROUGH URL:
Route::get("user/{id}",[UserController::class,'show']);
class UserController extends Controller
{
    function show($id){
        return $id;
    }
}
QUESTION?
We made the controller through command line, is it possible mannually?
