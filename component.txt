COMPONENT:
Component is a piece of code which we can reuse again and again.
For example, header and footer, they are same for the whole website. So, we can make a component for this and can use it again and again.
HOW TO MAKE A COMPONENT?
Through command line, 2 files will be generated, one will be php file and other html file.
php artisan make:component Header
- this will create component->header.blade.php
- View/Component->header.php

1. First, make a view hello.blade.php and call header:
<x-header />
OR If you want to pass the name of the page also:
<x-header componentName=>"Hello"> 
To get the name, go to header.php:
public $title="";
public function __construct($componentName)
    {
        $this->title=$componentName;
    }

2. In header.blade.php:
<h1>Header Component</h1>
OR
<h1>{{$title}}'s Header Component</h1>

3. Route hello.blade.php:
Route :: get('/hello',function(){
    return view('hello');
});

4. Now see how component works on other pages, make another view about.blade,php:
QUESTION?
Can we use components directly through route?
